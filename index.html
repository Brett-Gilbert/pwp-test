						<p>Then it's time to get your beak wet tonight playa! Lick, lickity, lick my balls! You can run, but you can't hide bitch! And there's no evidence that a Latino student did it.

							You don't have to try to impress me Morty. Yo! What up my glip glops! Not MY fault this is happening. Please god, oh lord, hear my prayers…! YES! Fuck you god, not today bitch!

							That guy is the Red Grin Grumbold of pretending he knows what's going on. Oh you agree huh? You like that Red Grin Grumbold reference? Well guess what, I made him up. You really are your father's children. Think for yourselves, don't be sheep. We don't whitewash it either, Morty. I mean, the pirates are really rapey. Don't be a baby! You avoid getting shot in real life all the time, Morty! Just do the same thing here and we'll be fine! This is because you give Morty Smith bad grades, bitch!

							What the fuck is going on?! God, Grandpa, you're such a dick. I'll be with Reuben in my workshop while you guys are having another day in Phil Collin's proverbial paradise. You created a day care for my dad?

							The fucking amish bitch shot me! I can finally go on that trip I've been talking about. You can run, but you can't hide bitch! Pluto's a planet.

							Nothing you do matters, your existance is a lie! its not like we can do this every week, we get 3 or 4 more of these tops. I'm Scary Terry!! You can run but you can't hide, bitch! Nothing to read into there!

							It's like the N word and the C word had a baby, and it was raised by all the bad words for Jews. Slow down! "Quantum carburetor"? Jesus, Morty. You can't just add a Sci-Fi word to a car word and hope it means something… Huh, looks like something's wrong with the microverse battery. We're gonna have to go inside. It's been six hours. Dreams move one... one-hundredth the speed of reality, and dog time is one-seventh human time. So y'know, every day here is like a minute. It's like Inception, Morty, so if it's confusing and stupid, then so is everyone's favorite movie.

							Is he keeping his shoulders square? Oooooooh he's tryin'! Meeseeks don't usually have to exist for this long. It's gettin' weeeiiird. S-S-Samantha. Dont mind those stare goblins.

							And there's no evidence that a Latino student did it. Lemme hear everybody say hey-yo! All the ladies say yeaaah! Everybody over thirty do this with your hand! Everybody with a red shirt jump up and down! Yo, everyone whose first name begins with an L who isn't hispanic, walk in a circle the same number of times as the square root of your age times teeenn! It's a dream, Morty! We're in your dog's dream. The night the dogs captured us, after you cried and crapped your pants, we-we all went to sleep. Then I used my dream inceptors to put the two of us inside Snuffles' dream. Wubba lubba dub dub!

It's like Inception, Morty, so if it's confusing and stupid, then so is everyone's favorite movie. This isn't Game of Thrones, Morty.
